2.) Travel Tips and tricks

1.Buy a small backpack/suitcase
By purchasing a small backpack (I like something around 35/40 liters), you will be forced you to pack light and avoid carrying too much stuff.

2. Pack light
It’s OK to wear the same t-shirt a few days in a row. Take half the clothes you think you will need…you won’t need as much as you think.

15.Get travel insurance
Travel insurance is the most important thing you get that you never want to use. If something goes wrong, you don’t want to be out thousands of dollars in bills. It will be there if you get robbed, flights get cancelled, you get sick or injured, or have to be sent home.

3. Don’t be afraid to use a map.
Looking like a tourist isn’t as bad as getting really lost and ending up in the wrong neighborhood. Don’t be afraid to use a map or ask for directions and look like a tourist.

4. Travel by yourself at least once
You’ll learn a lot about yourself and how to become independent. It’s a cliché, but it’s true. Traveling solo taught me how to fend for myself, talk to people, and handle unfamiliar situations with ease.

5.Always visit the tourism office.
They know about everything going on in town. They can point you to free activities, special events happening during your stay, and everything in between.

6. Always carry a lock.
They come in handy, especially when you stay in dorms and need to lock your stuff up.

7.Make extra copies of your passport and important documents.
Don’t forget to e-mail a copy to yourself too. You never know when you might need to have some sort of documentation with you and might not want to carry your original.

8.Learn basic phrases in the native language of your destination
The locals will appreciate it and it will make your interactions easier. You don’t need to master the language but learning a few things like “Hello,” “Goodbye,” “Thank you!”,


10.Never eat in a touristy area or near a tourist attraction
As a general rule, I walk five blocks in either direction before I find a place to eat. The closer you are to tourist attractions the more you are going to pay and the worse the food (and service).

11.Carry a basic first-aid kit.
Accidents happen so be prepared. I take band-aids, antibacterial cream, and ointments for minor cuts and scrapes.

12.Try new food.
Don’t ask what it is. Just put it in your mouth and see if you like it. If you put your guard up, you might miss out on some unusual and delicious local cuisine.

13.Carry emergency cash.
Because emergencies happen. Like that time in Romania when I couldn’t find an ATM and needed money for the bus to the hostel! 

14.Eat street food!
If you skip the street food, you miss out on culture. Don’t be scared. If you’re nervous, look for places where kids are eating. If it’s safe for them, it’s safe for you



16.Be patient
Things will work out in the end. No need to rush. You’ll get to where you are going in due time.

17.Be respectful.
Locals are willing to help you out, but there’s probably a language barrier, so keep your cool when something doesn’t go your way. 

111. Relax
Be Patient

18.Don’t overplan your trip.
Let your days unfold naturally. Schedule two or three things and let the day fill in the rest on its own. It’s less stressful, and letting the day just take you is one of the best ways to travel

20.Leaving with your comfort zone
 cite leaving my comfort zone as the number one way in which travel has helped me. It was leaving my comfort zone that gave me confidence in my abilities as a traveller. 

21.take a good camera.

Your photos will be some of your best memories, so invest in a good camera. And, of course, take the time to understand how it works before you leave.

22.Have a health checkup before you leave

Visit your doctor and dentist for a checkup before you leave. The last thing you want to happen is for you to set off and discover new things.
